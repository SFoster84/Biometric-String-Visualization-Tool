If you type a string of characters frequently, you will type them differently than someone else based on your muscle memory. This tool visualizes that difference. The x-axis shows elapsed time between characters, the y-axis and circle diameters show the duration of each keystroke. Each time you type the string, each keystroke is visualized, keystrokes from the same string are the same color.

It's built using AngularJS, D3.js, Bootstrap 3, and Google Fonts.
